:repo: https://github.com/swobspace/cocard

== Installation and start

Setup directory and configuration::
Copy the content from {repo}/podman/playground to a local directory.

Check configuration::
Check the contents of the files in `./playground/cocard/.` For the first run you can use the files unchanged.

Create the pod::
----
bash create-playground.sh
----
The script creates a pod with the name `play-cocard`.

Start the pod::
----
podman pod start play-cocard
----

Access cocard via browser::
* `http://localhost:3001`
* login: `admin`
* password: `admin9999`

Don't forget to change your admin password.

Connect to your first mirth connect system::
See admin manual (coming soon).


== Unresolved issues

* You need to start the pod twice the first time. The postgresql setup takes too much time - so stop and start your pod a second time.
